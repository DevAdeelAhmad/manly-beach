## Design Changes and Iterations

Throughout the development process, several design changes and iterations were made based on user feedback:

1. **Responsive Navigation**:

   ```

2. **Hero Section Enhancement**:
   A video background was added to the hero section to make it more engaging.

   ```html:index.html
   startLine: 39
   endLine: 50
   ```

3. **Interactive Explore Section**:
   The explore section was redesigned with interactive cards that reveal more information on hover.

   ```html:index.html
   startLine: 128
   endLine: 166
   ```

4. **Getting There Section**:
   A new section was added to provide transportation information and an embedded map.

## Reflections on Design Changes

1. **Responsive Design**: The addition of a responsive navigation menu greatly improved the mobile user experience, making it easier for users to navigate the site on smaller screens.

2. **Video Background**: The video background in the hero section adds a dynamic element to the page, immediately capturing the user's attention and showcasing the beauty of Manly Beach.

3. **Interactive Elements**: The hover effects on the explore cards and the activity carousels increase user engagement and make the site more interactive.

4. **Information Architecture**: The addition of the "Getting There" section provides crucial information for visitors planning their trip, enhancing the overall usefulness of the site.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading was implemented for images to improve page load times, especially on slower connections.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a fully functional booking system for activities and accommodations.
2. Add a user review and rating system for activities and locations.
3. Integrate a weather API to provide real-time weather information for Manly Beach.
4. Create a mobile app version of the website for easier access on smartphones.
